# C++ Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in C++. The program allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. Run the program in a C++ compiler or IDE.
2. The game will display an empty 3x3 grid, with cells designated by numbers 1-9.
3. Player X always goes first and will be prompted to enter the cell number of their move.
4. Player X's move will be marked as X on the grid.
5. Player O will be prompted to enter their move.
6. Player O's move will be marked as O on the grid.
7. Steps 3-6 will repeat until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
8. The game will display the winner and exit.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns marking X and O on the grid.
- The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- The game ends when one player wins or the grid is filled without a winner (draw).

## File Structure

The program consists of the following files:

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main logic, game loop, and our array of board data.

## Dependencies

This program has no external dependencies. It is written in standard C++ and should work with any modern C++ compiler.

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile main.cc using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Execute the compiled binary to start the game.
